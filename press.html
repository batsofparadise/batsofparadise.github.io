    <div><h2>ABOUT THE ALBUM</h2></div>

    <div class="text-block">
      <p>Bats of Paradise was born in a darkened lab at a neuroscience research institute north of Toronto. Brought together by a grad school research project after years apart, Phil Johnston and Mia Gadbois rediscovered their shared reverence for the guitar-driven music they had bonded over as teenagers. Writing began that night – the first of many nights spent in a rented garage refining their dynamic, emotive songwriting. Facing the challenges of long-distance collaboration over the pandemic, they set themselves some simple rules to capture the momentum of those original sessions on their first EP: no synths, electronics, or involved sound design. This simple palette - just guitars and drum kit - was brought to life with the help of mixing by Jace Lasek (The Besnard Lakes) and mastering by Heather Kirby (Ohbijou). Over the course of these six songs, Bats of Paradise steady themselves against the vertigo of life in the 2020s by embracing its contradictions: the urgent and the abstract, the noisy and serene.</p>

      <p>"‘Head Like a Hornet’s Nest’ makes for something that reminds of ‘Pablo Honey’ era Radiohead, an innocence but a lens to a talent that is burgeoning before our very eyes. Yes, this Toronto act got me excited because in holding back somewhat ‘Head Like A Hornet’s Nest’ felt like explosive material."</p>
